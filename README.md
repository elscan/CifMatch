# CifMatch
Given a list of reflections from your PXRD scan and the wavelength, find the CIF file that most closely matches your diffraction profile

There should just be one file, _FindBestMatchToReflectionList.py <br/>
The instructions are written in _FindBestMatchToReflectionList.py and are copied below

\#----- Instructions -----# <br/>
\# Above is a list, tThets <br/>
\# For your diffraction pattern, enter into tThets a list of 2-theta values, in degrees, where there are reflections <br/>
\# Above is a variable, wavelength <br/>
\# change wavelength to the wavelength your experiment was done at <br/>
\# Put this file into a folder with all the .cif files that you want to search through <br/>
\# Run the file from the anaconda prompt/command prompt/terminal (it is assumed the user knows how to do this) <br/>
\# A file, 2ThetaHits.csv should appear in the folder with all the .cif files that you want to search through <br/>
\# Have a look at 2ThetaHits.csv
